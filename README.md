# HackyHelper - A Hackathon Management Platform By The Hackers For The Hackers

## Inspiration

While participating in various virtual hackathons and collaborating with folks remotely over the summer has been extremely exciting, there are certain issues that we have faced while developing and managing our projects. In the past hackathons that we have attended or organized, we have seen that out of the total registered participants, even if 75% of the folks show up for the final event, only about 30% are actually able to complete their projects and submit for judging. A major reason for this is that while hackathons can be a ton of fun, they can be quite chaotic for teams, especially for those with rookie hackers.

There are some extremely common issues that we have noticed while developing the project. Issues such as haywire management of notes during ideation, delays in communicating project updates, maintaining a list of to-dos to be completed, etc., can hamper the productivity of a team significantly in the overall hackathon process. At this point, we have not yet discovered a project management tool that has dedicatedly been made keeping ease-of-use for beginners in mind. Therefore, we decided to create a hackathon management platform created from the hackerâ€™s perspective.

And thus, **HackyHelper** was born :D

## What it does

**HackyHelper** is a hackathon project management platform designed for hackers to assist them in streamlining their development process from ideation to demo. With various functionalities that include (but are not limited to) sticky notes for ideation, Figma embed for easy access of wireframes, to-do lists to keep track of pending work, a Markdown editor to manage documentation, GitHub integration to manage the team members, and a nice little Spotify playlist to groove along with, HackyHelper is the Operations Control Center that hackers need to manage their projects. It is truly a solution **by the hackers, for the hackers**!
